Description: 

The Tmog of the item "https://wowwiki-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Vile_Fumigator%27s_Mask" is not working. it only shows the mask but not those 2 bottles on ur back. 
I think visuals are bugged.

How to reproduce:

I bought T-mog from T-mog trader in Dalaran. After using the T-mog on my item i just get the "mask" visual but without the 2 bottles on my back. 

How it should work:

The T-mog should be corrected so the 2 bottles should be added on your back after t-mogging the item.
